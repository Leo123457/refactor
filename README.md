# Refactor

## Introduction

This is the code I wrote for the problem "Expression Tree" on judgegirl.
Here is the [link to the question](https://judgegirl.csie.org/problem/0/65),
and I also save the problem description in `65.md` for easier access.
I'll gradually refactor the code using the techniques taught in class (CSIE1211).

## Testing

To check whether my code is correct, I wrote a shell script to download
test data and another script to compare the output of my code with the answer.
I can run `./get N` to download test data for problem `N` and `./test N`
to test the code for problem `N`.
